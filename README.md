Simulation of Flexible Multibody Dynamics of a 2DOF crane performed in python using Exudyn package.
The repo is structured as follows:

* __Code/__ contains python code
* __3D Models/__ contain SolidWorks part file (2024 version) and STEP file of realistic Boom and Stick
* __ABAQUS/__ contain ABAQUS inp file for full FEA simulation of the same crane model. Figures added for reference.
* __Figures/__ contains screenshots from exudyn simulation. Comparison between full FEA and reduced Exudyn model.
